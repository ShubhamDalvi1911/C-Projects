# C-Projects

**Guess Game 1 to 100**
  A simple C program where two players compete to guess a randomly generated number between 1 and 100. The player who guesses the number with fewer attempts wins the game!

# Features

  Random number generation for a fun and fair game.
  Player vs. Player mode.
  Feedback to help players guess the number (higher/lower hints).
  Displays the winner or declares a tie based on the number of guesses.

# How to Play

  Run the program.
  Choose an option from the menu:
    1. START: Begin a new game.
    2. PLAY Again: Play another round.
    3. EXIT: Exit the game.
  Each player takes turns guessing the number between 1 and 100.
  After each guess, the program provides feedback:
    "Guess the LOWER number" if the guess is too high.
    "Guess the HIGHER number" if the guess is too low.
  The player who guesses the number in fewer attempts wins.
  If both players take the same number of attempts, it's a tie!
